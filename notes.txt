   Kristin Qi         TA           Cleared up confusion on how I needed to use nested for loops and if
                                   statements in the constructor for hamming, manhattan, and blankPos.

   Kyle Clapper       TA           Cleared up confusion on whether or not a board is solvable based on whether
                                   its size is even or odd and whether its inversion count is even or odd. (Piazza)

   Prateeksha Bhojaraj TA          Cleared up confusion on how to push the goal board and its previous boards onto
                                   the instance variable "solution"'s stack using a loop. Also cleared up confusion
                                   on the arguments of the SearchNode inserted into MinPQ<SearchNode> pq in the last
                                   part of the constructor. (Piazza)

   Swaminathan Iyer    Teacher     Cleared up confusion on the arguments of the SearchNode inserted into pq in the last
                                   part of the constructor. Also cleared up confusion on the conditions in which a new
                                   SearchNode should be inserted into pq. (Piazza)

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was very difficult and had me thinking really hard about the concept behind it. For Problem 1 I often
   had to think very hard about a board, how it moves, its solvability, etc. even during times that I was not directly
   working on the code/project. Something that helped me a lot, other than seeking advice from Piazza, was drawing the
   boards and using trial and error to figure out things such as the row-major position equation. The hints in
   Gradescope were also very helpful. Reading and understanding the context behind the project is also very important. I
   could have solved a problem(inversion count and solvability), that I asked on Piazza, by myself if I had just read
   the context to the project and understood it better. Both parts of the project were very confusing, but as I slowly
   started to understand it and got my code right, by the time I got my code right I was able to understand their
   concepts. I enjoyed doing the project, but it was also very frustrating to do. This project definitely taught me a
   lot about the concepts behind them.
